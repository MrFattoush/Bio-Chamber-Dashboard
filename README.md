# Bio-Chamber-Dashboard

Mind in Vitro Data Analysis UI

📌 Overview 
This project was developed as part of my Undergraduate Research at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (May 2024 – August 2024) under the Mind in Vitro program.

The application provides a user interface and web-based platform for analyzing environmental sensor data—specifically:

- CO₂ concentration
- Humidity levels
- Temperature readings

These data streams were collected from living neurons housed in a robotic-bio chamber, enabling real-time monitoring and visualization.

⚠️ Note: The data provided in this repository is simulated and does not reflect actual research data due to privacy and confidentiality requirements.
⚙️ Features:
  - Built using Python and HTML for backend logic and frontend visualization.
  - Supports analysis and visualization of environmental sensor data.
  - Provides an accessible interface for researchers and students.
  - Designed to be lightweight and adaptable to similar bio-data collection systems.

👥 Collaboration
During this research project, I worked closely with students from other STEM disciplines. This included:
  - Participating in team-building and collaborative exercises.
  - Sharing domain knowledge across fields.
  - Contributing leadership and organizational input on technology stack decisions, algorithms, and data workflows.

🚀 Future Improvements
  - Expand support for additional sensor inputs.
  - Add real-time data streaming and visualization.
  - Improve user interface with modern web frameworks.
